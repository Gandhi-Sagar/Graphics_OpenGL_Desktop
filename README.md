# Graphics_OpenGL_Desktop

These are few OpenGL Programs using programmable pipeline 3.3. 
As you might be aware, OpenGL is one of the complex platforms to work on. 
This code is here to demonstrate my coding skills. Being possessive about my programs, its hard to put all of my code in public repositories, I am reading about licences, once I figure out the safe way, I'll post more codes.

By any means this does not mean I only have these many codes, this is just a framework demonstration. 

Enjoy!
